# MyGame
My first console game and still working on applying OOP principles in best possible way.
TODO:
   - auto resizing of the console screen/game screen
   - organaise classes into folders and subfolders
   - improve abstraction and encapsulation
   - add instruction of how to play the game
   - have a player and score history
   - snake position and berry position to be implemented through the position/location class
